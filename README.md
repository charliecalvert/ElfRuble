ElfRuble
========

This is an add on (a Ruble) for Aptana.

If you have Aptana, go to your UserName/Aptana Rubles directory. This
directory might have a path a bit like this one, if you use Windows:

	C:\Users\UserName\Aptana Rubles

On Linux it will be in your documents directory:

	$HOME/Documents/Aptana Rubles

Now install this ruble by typing:

git clone https://github.com/charliecalvert/ElfRuble.git

Then restart Aptana and choose: **File | New | Web Project**. You
should see options to create an **Angular Karma** or **Angular Mongo
Bootstrap Test** project. Select either one and create a new project.

These projects are created from a zip file, and do not have a .git
folder.
